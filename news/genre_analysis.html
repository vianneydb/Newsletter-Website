                    <p class="blog-post-meta">February 29, 2024 by <a href="../yop.html">Vianney Diaz</a></p>

                    <p><b>SUBJECT:</b>  Community genre analysis to the Potterhead fans club.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Fans Club</h4>

                    <p>The Potterhead community is extensive and diverse around the world, derived from the wizarding world of J.K. Rowling, this community has faced uncountable changes, broadcast media, interactive spaces, and interpretations thanks to the large number of people who make up the fandom. With the constant new information that the author and some of their follower bring up to the discussion, this imaginary world has a place for any person who wants to intern to the community.</p>

                    <p>The saga of movies and the saga of books of "Harry Potter" are the two principal media that enchanted people with this fascinating story, and these two genres open a discussion about which is the best media to deep into the wizarding world.</p>

                    <p>In this genre analysis, we will discuss the audience, communication effectiveness, deep details, and best entertaining media for the diffusion of the Harry Potter wizarding world.</p>
                    
                    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Harry Potter</h4>

                    <p>Harry Potter's saga has an impact on a very diverse community, the first book was published in 1997, in the United Kingdom, and the principal audience of this saga was children and teenagers of the time.</p>

                    <p>With the popularization of the saga, the community was expanded geographically to different places in the world. Then the Saga was adapted cinematographically in 2001 by the director Chris Columbus, this adaptation diversified the community to other audiences such as young adults and cinephiles, and rapidly was criticized by a wide public.</p>

                    <p>The different film adaptations were made by different directors and each one left their particular essence in each of the films, which makes the movie genre more diverse than books and offers the audience the possibility to explore different experiences in each movie.</p>

                    <div style="margin: 2rem;">
                        <img width="560" height="315" src="../images/Harry-potter.jpg" alt="Harry Potter">
                        <p style="font-size: 12px; color: rgb(100, 100, 100);">Harry Potter | Warner Bros  </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Instead, the books follow a constant narrative by the writer J.K. Rowling. Along the saga, we can explore different topics, being the first four books a very light and juvenile lecture, and the other three books getting more mature literature that evolves with the principal characters, and also, with the audience.</p>

                    <p>Most of the people in the fandom are strongly attached to the original book version, causing you to get completely caught up with the extensive descriptive narration that the author brings to the audience, the completely deep into the magic world, and how the imagination and continuity of the story fit in a very organic way.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes the movie falls short in talking about details, scenes, or specific chapters and situations that in the book make you feel empathy with the principal character and feel that you understand the life of a young orphan and magician-student, instead of the movie that falls in focus only in the chosen one cliche and how the entire saga depends on him when in books we can imagine the entire magic world, and how the principal character is a consequence of that independent world and not the other way around.</p>

                    <p>The cinematographic adaptation is faithfully attached to the narrative of the book and allowed a unification of the general aesthetic in the fandom, this allowed the public to have a clearer vision of the author's perspective, in addition, it allowed the fandom to have more material to reproduce in other media, that is how the community grew and spread in many other ways besides reading forums or in cinemas, now we could see it at thematic conventions, in clubs, and even recently on social media like TikTok or Twitter, making the community grow more and more without much advertising effort.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>In addition, being a very extensive world, there were some gaps in the story, the author allowed the fandom to create theories, conspiracies, and even alternate universes with the story, letting them exploit the main idea of the story and making the fans get excited trying to solve enigmas of the story itself.</p>

                    <p>The Harry Potter books and movies are two distinct yet related forms of media that have attracted audiences around the world. While the original book offered a more immersive and expansive narrative experience, the film transforms the magic of the Wizarding World into a visually stunning cinematic spectacle, but both created and encouraged the community as it grew, allowing them to explore more about the magical world and leaving them a legacy of fiction and entertainment.</p>
