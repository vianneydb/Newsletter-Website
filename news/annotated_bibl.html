                                <p>This chapter explains the duel as the loss of someone emotionally close, the two principal patterns of the duel, intuitive (emotional) and instrumental (rational), and the different responses of the body about this process, which most of the time results in physical symptoms, emotional responses, and cognitive reactions. The author tells us about the importance of grief, and how it is important for the superation of a trauma.</p>
                                <p>Explains how different models of grief were discarded because the process is not linear and although each human being has different phases that they go through, there are specific phases that every human being goes through as a rule.</p>

                                <p>It is a comprehensive exploration of the cognitive and communicative aspects of romantic relationships. This book explores how memory, communication, and social cognition play key roles in the development and deterioration of romantic relationships.</p>
                                <p>The authors review evolving communication models and respond to criticisms of these models. They also explore the stages of relationship escalation and deterioration, covering the process of meeting new people, dating, having sex, and ending the relationship. This book draws on current research to discuss systemic gender differences in how people view romance and relationships.</p>
                                <p>This work provides an expanded analysis and review of research on how romantic thinking is shaped and influenced by communication processes, thereby providing a deeper understanding of the cognitive and communication factors involved in relationship dynamics.</p>

                                <p>This article on the effects of romantic relationship breakups on adolescents and young adults examines and evaluates the results of various studies and evaluates them with mathematical models, to know if in reality the quality of romantic relationships (RRQ) and romantic relationship breakups Romantic relationships (RRB) are directly related to the mental health of the population, as well as the generation of mental problems such as depression, stress and self-injury.</p>
                                <p>The results showed that the RRQ has a greater effect on the mental health of young people than the RRB, affecting either positively or negatively the quality of the relationship, in addition to showing that the emotional impact of a breakup in a romantic relationship could be even stronger at younger ages compared to older ages.</p>
                                <p>In addition, it is suggested that women may have a greater susceptibility to depression after RRB. It also asks that these parameters be considered to clinically determine the effects of this phenomenon, which often tends not to be taken with greater importance.</p>

                                <p>A study published in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health indicates that antidepressant use among older Finns was higher in women, suggesting greater emotional stress. Even getting a new partner only resulted in a slight reduction in antidepressant use.</p>
                                <p>These findings suggest that the emotional consequences of union dissolution are more burdensome for women than for men. Personal experiences and expert perspectives reveal that breakups can trigger depression in women, and the importance of support from friends, family, and mental health professionals is crucial during these difficult times.</p>
                                <p>In conclusion, the dissolution of a relationship has a profound impact on women's mental health, and it is essential to recognize this emotional burden and ensure they have access to the necessary support.</p>

                                <p>The neuropsychology Stephanie Ortigue and the anthropology Helen Fisher, explain that romantic attraction is based not only on the sexual drive but also attachment and romantic love, which seek a deep emotional connection.</p>
                                <p>The chemistry between two people can be influenced by factors such as similarity in values, education, and socioeconomic background. Fisher identifies four “biological personalities” based on levels of dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, and estrogen, which influence mutual attraction.</p>
                                <p>Ortigue highlights that low self-esteem can lead to negative relationships, while an intimate and personal connection with your partner can foster the growth of love.
                                    A lack of personal growth can lead to loss of interest and potentially infidelity.
